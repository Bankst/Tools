Notes:
- ShineTable: _eof and _srFile.EndOfStream  ??
- Why not inherit ShineTable from DataTable? Also, partial, making things ugly?
- There's a better release for SHNFile in Fiesta Editor, try to use that one?
- Make StaticValues const strings, not readonly-static.
- For easier settings, you can create a settings class, make them public properties and serialize the object (does thesame as current code)

Great job btw, you gave me some ideas.
